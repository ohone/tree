# Tree (ERC721)

## Overview

**Initial Supply**: 10000

**Initial Growth Rate**: 100ðŸªµ per-block

Trees are a core building-block of the in-game economy, as the only way to produce new [Wood](wood.md).

Each block that is mined, the tree grows and the underlying amount of ðŸªµ increases.

Claiming ðŸªµ from a tree reduces its size and growth rate (see Claim Wood)


## Claim Wood

Trees  can be 'claimed' to recieve an amount (up-to the total) of the underlying [Wood](wood.md). 

Each time a tree is cut, the rate the tree grows per block is reduced.

When a tree is cut down completely, the NFT is burned and the tree will produce no further wood.
